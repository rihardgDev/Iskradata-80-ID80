Iskradata 80, or ID80 for short, is a distributed computer system developed and produced in 1979 and 1980 by the company Iskra TOZD Computers in Kranj, with the cooperation of the German company ADPS. The ID80 was a microcomputer with a modular design, so it was easy to adapt to the user's requirements.
It was a buisnes computer, which its reflected in hardware, software and price.

Terminal for ID80 is called ID 168.


It came out in a few different formats:  
Iskradata 80-50 - Printer, system with printer  
Iskradata 80-60 - Freelance position  
Iskradata 80-70 - Communication position  
Iskradata 80-75 - Synchronous terminal  
Iskradata 80-80 - Standalone parent system  
Iskradata 80-90 - Communication matrix system  
Distributed processing allowed access to the database on another computer on the network. It was possible to use a single stand-alone computer, or up to 16 computers in total connected as workstations using the communication module. The working units were connected via the RS-232 bus and communicated with each other using synchronous or asynchronous protocols, which also enabled transmission control.  
It used the IDOS or CP/M operating system and worked with the programming languages ​​Basic and Pascal. The host computer could read up to 4 disk drives, up to 300 MB in size.
